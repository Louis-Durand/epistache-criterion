# Epistache Criterion
Epistache for Epitech

## Part 1

Your first step is to clone this repository.
You will then be tasked with correcting the code inside so that all criterion tests pass.
This is not a hard step but note that these mistakes may seem easy to spot for you, but in general, these are similar mistakes as the ones you make and they can ruin your project.

You should know how to use a Makefile by now, so Good luck :)

###### Attention: You should not modify any test files, we consider that they were coded before the rest and so they are what we expect our functions to do


## Part 2

Now that you've learnt or revised what criterion does and what functions are available to you, you will have to think of all the tests you can do on an exercice.

### Step 2.1

Read thoroughly the following exercice:

Bri ish name formatter:

Write a program that takes a string as parameter representing a name and pretty print it, according to the following rules:

- a name is composed of a first name followed by a last name,
- if any of the words contain the letters 'tu', you must replace it by 'chew'
- if any of the words contain a letter 'th', you must replace it by 'f'
- if any of the words contain a letter 't', you must replace it by ' ', be carefull, the two above rules take priority in the case of the following letter being a 'u' or 'h'
- the first letters of every word must be printed in upper case; the others in lower case

###### All the string given will be well formed, with both a correct first name and a correct last name.

### Step 2.2

Now your turn to play, after having understood the exercice, you should take 5 minutes to think of what functions you will need.

### Step 2.3

Now that you thought of all the functions you will need, write all the criterion tests possible on those functions.

```C
A gentle reminder to criterion
Test(group_name, test_name)
{
    // The code that I want to test
}
```

### Step 2.4 (Optional)

Now that you have the prototypes of the functions you need to code and the tests, you should know exactly what to do !
